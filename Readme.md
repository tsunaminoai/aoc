# Advend of Code 2023

And yet I'm writing the readme in 2024/03, so sue me.

I'm still learning zig, so I'm going to use this as an opportunity to learn more about it.

## Playing along

If anyone wants to play along, I've got a nix flakes setup, so you can just run `nix develop` and then `zr <daynumber>` to run the code for that day (if it exists).

Type `menu` to see the available commands.
